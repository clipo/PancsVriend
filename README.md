# Schelling Segregation Simulator (Enhanced Edition)

This project implements an extended version of the Schelling Segregation Model based on Pancs & Vriend (2007). The simulation demonstrates how individual preferences for neighborhood composition‚Äîeven preferences *for integration*‚Äîcan unintentionally lead to segregation.

## üÜï Comprehensive Experiment Framework

This enhanced version includes a complete experimental framework for comparing mechanical agents with LLM-based agents under various social contexts, with sophisticated statistical analysis and visualization capabilities.

## üîç What It Does

This Python-based simulation models a 2D grid-based society of agents from two groups (e.g., Group A and Group B). Each agent evaluates its neighborhood and decides whether to stay or move based on how satisfied it is with its current surroundings. Satisfaction is calculated via a utility function, and agents perform **best-response dynamics** to relocate.

### Core Features

- **Spatial Agent-Based Simulation**
- **6 Segregation Metrics Tracked:**
  - Cluster count
  - Switch rate
  - Distance to unlike neighbors
  - Mix deviation
  - Share measure
  - Ghetto rate
- **Graphical User Interface** using `pygame` and `pygame_gui`
- **CSV logging** of metrics per timestep
- **Live plotting** of metric trends (`matplotlib`)
- **LLM Decision Mode**: Switches from mechanistic decision logic to LLM-based reasoning using Ollama

---

## üí° Expected Behavior

This simulator demonstrates that:
- Even mild or integration-favoring preferences can result in rapid segregation.
- Segregation persists despite agents preferring mixed neighborhoods.
- LLM agents may exhibit different movement patterns compared to traditional best-response agents depending on their interpretive logic.

You can switch between:
- **Mechanistic Mode** ‚Äî classic Schelling-style myopic best response.
- **LLM Mode** ‚Äî context-aware decision making using large language models like `qwen2.5-coder:32B`.

---

## üß™ Comparing Mechanistic vs. LLM Agents

To evaluate how LLMs differ from traditional agents:

1. **Set `USE_LLM = False`** in `config.py` and run the simulation. Observe CSV metrics and live plots.
2. **Set `USE_LLM = True`**, then choose a model from the dropdown in the GUI.
3. Run identical scenarios (same population and initial conditions) and compare:
   - How quickly segregation occurs.
   - Whether more or fewer agents end up in ghettos.
   - The variation in number of clusters.
   - Whether LLM agents behave in a more nuanced or chaotic way.
4. Export and analyze logged data (`segregation_metrics.csv`) for both modes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

Edit `config.py`:

```python
USE_LLM = True  # or False
OLLAMA_MODEL = "qwen2.5-coder:32B"
OLLAMA_URL = "https://chat.binghamton.edu/api/chat/completions"
OLLAMA_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Start the Simulation

```bash
python SchellingSim.py
```

---

## üß≠ Interface Controls

- **LLM Toggle**: Switch between classic and LLM-driven agents
- **Model Dropdown**: Select an active model deployed on your local or institutional Ollama server
- **Live Graphs**: 6 panels show evolving segregation metrics
- **CSV Logging**: `segregation_metrics.csv` accumulates all time-step data

---

## üß† LLM Agent Behavior

The LLM agents receive a 3x3 local neighborhood context like:

```
[
 ["S", "E", "O"],
 ["X", "S", "E"],
 ["O", "S", "E"]
]
```

Where:
- `S` = Same group
- `O` = Opposite group
- `E` = Empty cell
- `X` = Out of bounds

They're prompted to return coordinates of the best location to move to. You can use this to test:
- Reasoning under partial satisfaction
- Interpretations of ‚Äúintegration‚Äù or ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù
- Exploration vs. exploitation in movement

---

## üìä Output Files

- `segregation_metrics.csv` ‚Äî logs step-by-step values for 6 metrics
- Live graphical window ‚Äî shows the evolving grid and metric plots
- Console output ‚Äî for error/debug logs if needed

---

## üõ† Future Additions

- Snapshot export of grid states
- Configurable utility curves
- Batch run comparison tools
- Cluster heatmaps or agent movement traces

---

## ‚úÖ Recent Fixes and Performance Improvements

The current version of the simulation includes critical updates to make LLM-based movement both correct and efficient:

### üîÅ Correct LLM Coordinate Interpretation
LLM agents return 3√ó3 neighborhood-relative coordinates (centered at position (1,1)). These are now correctly translated to absolute grid positions before move validation. This has fixed the prior issue where agents repeatedly attempted to move to globally invalid or occupied cells.

### üß† Enhanced LLM Prompts
The agent prompt enforces strict formatting, asking for a tuple `(r, c)` or `None` ‚Äî and nothing else. This eliminates parsing ambiguity and ensures smooth operation.

### üìâ Faster and Parallel LLM Responses
The system uses a background worker model with `queue.Queue` and a thread pool to parallelize LLM calls. This enables smoother GUI responsiveness even when agent decisions are LLM-driven.

### üéØ GUI and Metric Updates
- The simulation loop now applies moves **before** drawing the grid.
- Metrics and visualizations now reflect real changes, and GUI updates are tied to actual agent behavior.
- Convergence logic prevents premature termination by ensuring the agent queue is fully processed.

If your LLM agents seem too cautious or always return `None`, consider tuning the prompt to reward movement or suggest alternative goals (e.g., diversity, centrality, clustering).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations and Batch Runs

### üîß Runtime Configurations

These options allow you to control performance and output:

- **Live Graphs Toggle**: Click "Toggle Graphs" to enable or disable live metric plotting.
  - Live graphs are OFF by default (faster simulation).
  - Turning them ON shows evolving metric plots in real-time.
- **Stop & Graph Button**: Ends the simulation and generates a **PDF summary** of all metric graphs from the current run (`final_metrics_summary.pdf`).
- **LLM Toggle**: Switch between mechanistic and LLM-based agents at any time.
- **LLM Model Dropdown**: Choose the LLM model used when `USE_LLM = True`.

---

### üì¶ Batch Mode Analysis

Use the included `batch_run.py` to run multiple simulations and aggregate results.

#### How It Works:

- Runs the simulation multiple times (default = 5)
- Collects metric values from `segregation_metrics.csv` after each run
- Computes **mean** and **standard deviation** per timestep
- Produces line plots with confidence intervals for each metric
- Saves results as `batch_<metric>.pdf` (e.g., `batch_clusters.pdf`)

#### To Run:

```bash
python batch_run.py
```

> Note: Currently assumes you manually close each simulation run.
> Full `--headless` mode is planned for future automation.

## üß™ Running in Batch Mode & LLM Experiments

### üîÅ Batch Runs

To compare performance across multiple runs (e.g., with and without LLMs), execute:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do python SchellingSim.py; done
```

Each run will log its convergence step in `convergence_summary.csv`, including:

- Step (timestep when convergence occurred)
- Whether LLM was used (`USE_LLM`)
- Model name (`OLLAMA_MODEL`)
- Total number of agents

You can analyze these using:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("convergence_summary.csv")
df.groupby("Model")["Step"].describe()
```

---

### ü§ñ LLM-Driven Behavior

To activate LLM decision-making:

1. Set `USE_LLM = True` in `config.py`.
2. Select a model from the dropdown in the GUI.
3. Ensure your Ollama server is running and the model is available.

---

### üß† Customizing LLM Queries

Modify `LLMAgent.py` to explore new agent preferences:

```python
prompt = f"What would an agent who values {context_theme} prefer as a neighborhood? Current neighborhood: {context}"
```

Replace `context_theme` with:

- `"racial composition"`
- `"ethnic background"`
- `"musical taste"`
- `"language spoken"`

This lets you simulate preferences for cultural affinity, communication compatibility, or lifestyle similarity.
