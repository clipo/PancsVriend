SEGREGATION METRICS ANALYSIS: LEGEND AND GLOSSARY
===============================================

SOCIAL CONTEXT SCENARIOS
------------------------

The segregation metrics compare agent behavior across five distinct social contexts 
within the Schelling framework:

• green/yellow (Baseline Control): Generic "red vs blue" teams without social 
  connotations, serving as a neutral baseline

• race:wht/blk (Racial Context): "White middle-class families" vs "Black families" - 
  captures residential preferences based on racial identity

• ethnicity (Ethnic Context): "Asian American families" vs "Hispanic/Latino families" - 
  examines ethnicity-based residential patterns

• income (Economic Context): "High-income professionals" vs "Working-class families" - 
  tests segregation based on economic class

• political (Political Context): "Liberal households" vs "Conservative households" - 
  measures political polarization in residential choices

• llm_baseline: LLM agents using the baseline control scenario

• mechanical: Traditional utility-maximizing agents with threshold-based decision 
  rules (non-LLM baseline)


SEGREGATION METRICS (PANCS-VRIEND FRAMEWORK)
-------------------------------------------

• Share: Proportion of same-type neighbor pairs (0.5 = perfect integration, 
  1.0 = complete segregation). Captures global segregation level.

• Clusters: Number of spatially contiguous same-type regions. Fewer clusters indicate 
  more consolidated ethnic enclaves. Note: Presented as -clusters since higher cluster 
  counts indicate less segregation.

• Distance: Average Manhattan distance to nearest different-type agent. Higher values 
  indicate greater spatial separation between groups.

• Ghetto Rate: Count of agents with zero different-type neighbors. Captures extreme 
  isolation and "ghettoization" - the most severe form of segregation.

• Mix Deviation: Average deviation from 50-50 local integration. Measures segregation 
  at the individual neighborhood level.

• Switch Rate: Frequency of type changes along agent borders. Higher values indicate 
  more jagged, intermixed boundaries. Note: Presented as -switch_rate since higher 
  switch rates indicate less segregation.


STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE NOTATION
---------------------------------

The inequality symbols indicate the strength of statistical relationships between scenarios:

• < : Strong consensus (≥5 out of 6 metrics agree) - highly significant difference
• ≤ : Weak consensus (≥1 metric agrees, no disagreement) - generally supported relationship
• ≤? : Mixed evidence (both agreements and disagreements) - uncertain relationship
• = : Perfect agreement (all 6 metrics agree) - equivalent segregation levels


SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS
------------------

Statistical significance is denoted by asterisk superscripts:

• * : p < 0.05 (statistically significant)
• ** : p < 0.01 (highly significant)
• *** : p < 0.001 (extremely significant)


INTERPRETATION
-------------

Overall Ordering: The consensus ranking synthesizes evidence across all six metrics 
to provide a single ordering from lowest to highest segregation levels.

Individual Metrics: Each metric captures a different dimension of segregation - from 
global patterns (Share) to local isolation (Ghetto Rate) to spatial structure 
(Clusters, Distance).

Key Finding: Political contexts produce the most extreme segregation (ghetto rate: 61.6, 
segregation share: 0.928), while economic contexts show minimal clustering (ghetto rate: 5.0, 
share: 0.543) - a 12.3× difference in ghetto formation based solely on social framing.
