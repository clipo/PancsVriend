SEGREGATION METRICS COMPARISON ACROSS LLM SCENARIOS
===================================================

OVERALL CONSENSUS ORDERING:
income ≤ green/yellow ≤ llm_baseline < race:wht/blk ≤ ethnicity < political

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-clusters      : (green/yellow, income) <^*** llm_baseline <^*** race:wht/blk <^*** ethnicity <^*** political

distance       : (green/yellow, income, llm_baseline) <^*** (ethnicity, race:wht/blk) <^*** political

ghetto_rate    : (green/yellow, income) <^* llm_baseline <^*** (ethnicity, race:wht/blk) <^** political

mix_deviation  : green/yellow <^** (income, llm_baseline) <^*** (ethnicity, race:wht/blk) <^*** political

share          : (green/yellow, income) <^* llm_baseline <^*** (ethnicity, race:wht/blk) <^*** political

-switch_rate   : (green/yellow, income, llm_baseline) <^*** (ethnicity, race:wht/blk) <^*** political

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
- Six metrics where more of the metric is associated with higher segregation
- Higher clusters and switch_rate are associated with LESS segregation,
  so -clusters and -switch_rate are presented for easier comparison
- Significance levels: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001
- Inequality symbols: < (strong consensus), ≤ (weak consensus), ≤? (mixed evidence)
