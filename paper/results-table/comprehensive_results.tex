\title{Segregation Metrics Analysis: Complete Results and Documentation}
\author{}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document presents comprehensive segregation metrics comparing LLM agent behavior across five social contexts within the Schelling framework: baseline control (green/yellow), racial (race:wht/blk), ethnic (ethnicity), economic (income), and political contexts. The analysis employs the Pancs-Vriend framework with six segregation metrics and includes both individual metric comparisons and an overall consensus ordering derived from cross-metric agreement patterns.

\section{Results Tables}

The following tables present segregation metric comparisons across different social contexts. Table~\ref{tab:segregation_metrics} shows the complete analysis including mechanical agents, while Table~\ref{tab:segregation_metrics_llm} focuses exclusively on LLM-based scenarios. Each table includes an overall consensus ordering synthesized from all six metrics, followed by individual metric comparisons with statistical significance indicators.

\section{Methodology Notes}

\subsection{Consensus Ordering Calculation}

The overall ordering represents a synthesis of evidence across all six segregation metrics. For each adjacent pair of scenarios in the ordering:

\begin{itemize}
\item We count how many metrics support each possible relationship (less than, greater than, or equal)
\item Consensus rules are applied:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Strong consensus ($<$): $\geq$5 out of 6 metrics agree on direction
  \item Weak consensus ($\leq$): $\geq$1 metric agrees with no disagreement  
  \item Mixed evidence ($\leq^?$): Both agreement and disagreement present
  \item Perfect agreement ($=$): All 6 metrics show identical values
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Research Implications}

The results demonstrate that LLM agents produce dramatically different segregation patterns based solely on social context framing:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Political contexts} show extreme segregation (ghetto rate: 61.6, share: 0.928)
\item \textbf{Economic contexts} show minimal clustering (ghetto rate: 5.0, share: 0.543)  
\item This represents a \textbf{12.3Ã— difference} in ghetto formation based purely on social framing
\item All scenarios differ significantly from baseline (p < 0.001)
\end{itemize}

These findings suggest that LLMs can capture culturally-embedded preferences and biases, producing segregation dynamics that vary realistically with social context.
