Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Human-like Decision Making in Agent-Based Models: 
A Comparative Study of Large Language Model Agents versus Traditional Utility Maximization 
in the Schelling Segregation Model" for consideration in Advances in Complex Systems.

This work presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based agents with traditional 
utility-maximizing agents in a classic agent-based model. Our key findings include:

1. LLM agents converge 2.2× faster to stable states than mechanical agents
2. Memory-enhanced LLMs reduce extreme segregation by 53.8%
3. Despite different mechanisms, final segregation levels are similar

We believe this work will be of significant interest to the ACS readership as it:
- Bridges AI and complexity science
- Offers new methods for realistic agent modeling
- Has practical implications for urban planning and policy

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

Thank you for considering our work.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
```
