# Three agent types for comprehensive comparison
agent_types:
  - standard    # Pure LLM agents (current context only)
  - memory      # Pure LLM agents with persistent memory

# Focus on baseline scenario
scenarios:
  - baseline    # Red vs Blue control scenario

# Optimized grid configuration (22.2% density - same as paper)
grid_configurations:
  optimized:
    grid_size: 15              # 225 total cells
    type_a: 25                 # 25 Type A agents  
    type_b: 25                 # 25 Type B agents (50 total = 22.2% density)

# Test parameters - quick validation
experiment_parameters:
  runs_per_config: 3           # 3 replicates for testing
  max_steps: 1000             # Max limit, expect early convergence
  use_llm_probability: 1.0    # Pure LLM agents

# Timeline Estimates for TEST (3 replicates):
# - Mechanical baseline: 3 runs × 187 steps × 0.02 sec/step = ~0.2 minutes
# - Standard LLM: 3 runs × 99 steps × 19 sec/step = ~1.6 hours  
# - Memory LLM: 3 runs × 84 steps × 19 sec/step = ~1.3 hours
# - Total Runtime: ~3 hours (perfect for testing)
