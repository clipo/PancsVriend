These two subfolders contain census tract level data for RACE and INCOME.

RACE: nhgis0002_csv/

INCOME: nhgis0003_csv/

Each subfolder has a codebook and a csv file. The csv files have a LOT of variables and the variables are NOT named in any kind of intuitive way at all. So you have to go into the codebook and look at what data you want to grab. 

Example, open nhgis0002_csv/nhgis0002_ds172_2010_tract_codebook.txt

First, are the Context Fields
	 which have the id information about the data, for example
	 	Which state is this census tract in? 
							STUSAB:      State/US-Abbreviation (USPS)
		What county in this census tract in?
							COUNTY:      County Name
        					COUNTYA:     County Code
							
Then there are the data fields, for example:
		H72001:      Total Population
        H72003:      Population of one race: White alone
        H72004:      Population of one race: Black or African American alone
        H72005:      Population of one race: American Indian and Alaska Native alone
        H72006:      Population of one race: Asian alone
        H72007:      Population of one race: Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone
        H72008:      Population of one race: Some Other Race alone
		
That should be enough of a guide to extract the data we want, which can then be used to construct county-level dissimilarity indexes
