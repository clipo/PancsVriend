# PURE COMPARISON STUDY CONFIGURATION
# Clean comparison of Mechanical vs Pure LLM vs Pure LLM+Memory agents

# Three pure agent types for clean comparison
agent_types:
  - standard    # Pure LLM agents (current context only)
  - memory      # Pure LLM agents with persistent memory

# Focus on key scenarios for meaningful comparison
scenarios:
  - baseline                    # Control: Red vs Blue (no social context)
  - race_white_black           # Most studied social context in segregation research

# Optimized grid configuration (37.5% density)
grid_configurations:
  optimized:
    grid_size: 20              # 400 total cells
    type_a: 75                 # 75 Type A agents  
    type_b: 75                 # 75 Type B agents (150 total = 37.5% density)

# Balanced parameters for meaningful results in reasonable time
experiment_parameters:
  runs_per_config: 3           # 3 runs for statistical validity
  max_steps: 50               # Sufficient to see segregation patterns
  use_llm_probability: 1.0    # Pure LLM agents (no mixing with mechanical)

# Timeline Estimates:
# - Total Experiments: 2 agent types × 2 scenarios × 1 grid = 4 experiments
# - Standard LLM: ~50 minutes per experiment × 2 = ~1.7 hours
# - Memory LLM: ~75 minutes per experiment × 2 = ~2.5 hours  
# - Plus mechanical baseline: ~5 minutes
# - Total Runtime: ~4-5 hours (manageable for overnight or weekend run)

# This gives pure comparison data:
# 1. Mechanical baseline (traditional Schelling model)
# 2. Standard LLM agents (human-like decisions, current context)
# 3. Memory LLM agents (human-like decisions with historical context)
# 4. Across control and racial segregation scenarios
